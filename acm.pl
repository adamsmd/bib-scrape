Classically, support for generic programming consists of two essential ingredients: a way to write (type-)overloaded functions, and independently, a way to access the structure of data types.) introduces a combinator library for generic programming that offers generic traversals and queries.

As a consequence, it is difficult to compare with other approaches such as PolyP or Generic Haskell. In this paper we reveal the structural view thatseems to lack the second. As a consequence, it is difficult to compare with other approaches such as PolyP or Generic Haskell. In this paper we reveal the structural view thatbuilds upon. This allows us to define the combinators as generic functions in the classical sense. We explain thebuilds upon. This allows us to define the combinators as generic functions in the classical sense. We explain theapproach in this changed setting from ground up, and use the understanding gained to relate it to other generic programming approaches. Furthermore, we show that theapproach in this changed setting from ground up, and use the understanding gained to relate it to other generic programming approaches. Furthermore, we show that theview is applicable to a very large class of data types, including generalized algebraic data types.view is applicable to a very large class of data types, including generalized algebraic data types.},
