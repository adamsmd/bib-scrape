doi and url should *not* be escaped if using the url package
All fields should be bare values (except perhaps 'note'):
  e.g. doi should not have 'doi:' or 'http://dx.doi.org/' at the front
       (one publisher even has 'doi: DOI:' at the front!
  e.g. abstract should not have the word "ABSTRACT" at the front
  e.g. pages should not have "p." or "pp." in it.
use url field for urls not the howpublished field
doi, isbn, issn should be present if available
names (e.g. author, editor) should be formatted "von last, first, jr"
  This is the only unambiguous format for latex
  Note RIS uses "last, jr, first"
url and note should be present only if it adds information
  Most publishers break this rule by linking to
  the publishers publication page.  It is
  understandable that they link there, but the
  URL doesn't actually add anything to the citation.
capitals:
  - Use proper capitalization (e.g. titlecase for titles).
    Even if your current bibliography style downcases titles,
    other styles may not.
  - Use {} to protect only characters that should
    not be upcased or downcased.  Thus "{H}askell"
    not "{Haskell}" since the latter would brake
    styles that upcase the text.
    - Unfortunately this means you can't grep for "Haskell"
      in your bibliography but even with "{Haskell}" you wouldn't
      be able to grep "Template Haskell".
      - As a workaround use "tr -d {}" to eliminate braces
        from the text before running grep.  (Feedback on better
        workarounds is welcome.)
no blank or zero fields
ranges are x--x
  - BibTeX accepts "x-x" but only for backwards compatibility purposes.
  - Page ranges are comma separated.
  - Single element "x" and multi-element "x+" ranges are allowed.
special chars are {\"o} not \"{o} (See the BibTeX FAQ)
journal is unabriviated
edition is "1st"???
quotes are proper form
Use a comma after the last field.  It is legal and makes copy-paste easier.
Continuously paginated journals
Non-sentensial periods

Does bibtex replace "K. Dybvig" with "K.~Dybvig"?
