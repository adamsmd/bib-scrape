# We can't assume a three part name is "first middle last" as some
# people have two words in their last name.  Further, publishers often
# get this wrong (e.g. "Jones, Simon Peyton") Thus we explicitly
# specify those names.

# Be careful with last names containing "van", "von", "di", "de", etc.
# Sometimes these parts of the names are capitalized, while other
# times they are not.  Always double check how the particular author
# spells it.
#
# Note that when they are lower case, bibtex treats them as a seperate
# part of the name, but when they are upper case, bibtex treats them
# as part of the last name.  Thus sometimes case insensitive match
# isn't enough to find the name.

# Sometimes the abbreviated form of a name is what was actually written
# on the article, but other times it's due to the publisher reporting
# the wrong data.  Here we can correct the publisher's error, mark the
# abriviation as correct, or use "[]" to give the full name.  (You can
# also just change it to the full name but then your bibliography
# would be lying if the original paper used the abbreviated name.)
