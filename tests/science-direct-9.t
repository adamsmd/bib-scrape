  abstract = {We present the {\it dynamically typed} {\lambda}-calculus, an extension of the statically typed {\lambda}-calculus with a special type Dyn and explicit {\it dynamic type coercions} corresponding to run-time type tagging and type check-and-untag operations. Programs in run-time typed languages can be interpreted in the dynamically typed {\lambda}-calculus via a nondeterministic {\it completion process} that inserts explicit coercions and type declarations such that a well-typed term results.

We characterize when two different completions of the same run-time typed program are {\it coherent} with an equational theory that is independent of an underlying {\lambda}-theory. This theory is refined by orienting some equations to define {\it safety} and {\it minimality} of completions. Intuitively, a safe completion is one that does not produce an error at run-time which another completion would have avoided, and a minimal completion is a safe completion that executes fewest tagging and check-and-untag operations amongst all safe completions.

We show that every untyped {\lambda}-term has a safe completion at any type and that it is unique modulo a suitable congruence relation. Furthermore, we present a rewriting system for generating minimal completions. Assuming strong normalization of this rewriting system we show that every {\lambda}{\it I}-term has a minimal completion at any type, which is furthermore unique modulo equality in the dynamically typed {\lambda}-calculus.},
