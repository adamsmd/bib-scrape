  abstract = {The sun occlusion experiment as proposed by\textsc{Matthews} was again repeated with a negative result. (First repeat in Wilhelmshaven, also with a negative result: K. and\textsc{A. Rawson}, this volume p. 168.)
{\par}
This does not conform to the sun navigation hypothesis. Some possibilities how to interpret the conflict of results obtained by the two research groups (Cambridge and Wilhelmshaven) are suggested (see p. 176).
{\par}
Apart from the diverging facts, the sun occlusion experiment needs further theoretical clarification. By the experimental procedure a fall of the midday sun altitude is observable and could in fact be interpreted as caused by a north displacement. Yet the curves traced by the sun at the release position (after the occlusion period) and at the false home (before the occlusion period) are very different, except for their common vertex. If the pigeon is supposed to compare a fragment of the seen sun path with a homologous fragment of the remembered sun path, the positional interpretation will diverge the more from\textsc{Matthews}' {\textquotedblleft}solstice home{\textquotedblright} spot, the more the release time differs from noon. E. g., in the early morning time, the observed sun path is parallel to the remembered home sun path with a deviation in azimuth which must be interpreted as caused by a considerable longitudinal (westward) displacement. No difference in midday altitude is detectable to the bird.
{\par}
There is one way to save the expectation of southward departures regardless of time of day: If the pigeon has the gift to extrapolate seen fragments of any sun curve independently of previous experience, it might be argued that only the midday point is furtherly used (even if it was not observed but determined by extrapolation). It also might be assumed that the observed part of the sun curve is promptly erased from the memory of the bird after having led to the completion of the arc. Yet this procedure of determining the midday point, involving pure mathematics without any help of remembered parts of the sun curve, would be conceivable only within the convex-upwards part of the sun path (from 6. a. m. to 6 p. m. local time). So the question is left to further investigation whether pigeons are unorientatet before 6 and after 18 h in the summer half year. On the other hand, it should be ascertained in the Cambridge region if, in the departure of sun-occluded pigions, there is a correlation between initial directions and time of day as would be expected if the pigeon compares sun path fragments. In this case, experimentally treated pigeons released in the early morning hours should steer east; those released about midday, south; those released near sun-set, west.},
