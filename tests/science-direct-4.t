  abstract = {We consider the {\it vertex cover} {\it P}\ensuremath{_\textrm{{\it n}}} ({\it VCP}\ensuremath{_\textrm{{\it n}}}) problem, that is, the problem of finding a minimum weight set {\it F}{\ensuremath{\subset}}{\it V} such that the graph {\it G}[{\it V}{\ensuremath{-}}{\it F}] has no {\it P}\ensuremath{_\textrm{{\it n}}}, where {\it P}\ensuremath{_\textrm{{\it n}}} is a path with {\it n} vertices. The problem also has its application background. In this paper, we restrict our attention to the {\it VCP}\ensuremath{_\textrm{3}} problem and give a 2-approximation algorithm using the technique of layering.},
