  abstract = {We consider the \emph{vertex cover} \emph{P}\ensuremath{_\textrm{\emph{n}}} (\emph{VCP}\ensuremath{_\textrm{\emph{n}}}) problem, that is, the problem of finding a minimum weight set \emph{F}{\ensuremath{\subset}}\emph{V} such that the graph \emph{G}[\emph{V}{\ensuremath{\minus}}\emph{F}] has no \emph{P}\ensuremath{_\textrm{\emph{n}}}, where \emph{P}\ensuremath{_\textrm{\emph{n}}} is a path with \emph{n} vertices. The problem also has its application background. In this paper, we restrict our attention to the \emph{VCP}\ensuremath{_\textrm{3}} problem and give a 2-approximation algorithm using the technique of layering.},
