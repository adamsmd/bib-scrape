  abstract = {We describe a package of practical tools and libraries for manipulating graphs and their drawings. Our design, which is aimed at facilitating the combination of the package components with other tools, includes stream and event interfaces for graph operations, high-quality static and dynamic layout algorithms, and the ability to handle sizeable graphs. We conclude with a description of the applications of this package to a variety of software engineering tools.},
