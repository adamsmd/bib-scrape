  abstract = {One of the goals of this paper is to demonstrate that denotational semantics is useful 
for operational issues like implementation of functional languages by abstract machines. 
This is exemplified in a tutorial way by studying the case of extensional untyped call-by-name 
{\lambda}-calculus with Felleisen's control operator [script C]. 
We derive the transition rules for an 
abstract machine from a continuation semantics which appears as a generalization of the 
{\textlnot}{\textlnot}-translation known from logic. The resulting abstract machine 
appears as an extension of Krivine's machine implementing head reduction. Though 
the result, namely Krivine's machine, 
is well known our method of deriving it from continuation semantics is new and applicable to 
other languages (as e.g. call-by-value variants). Further new results 
are that Scott's {\em D}\ensuremath{_\textrm{[infty infinity]}}-models 
are all instances of continuation models. Moreover, we extend our continuation semantics to 
Parigot's {\lambda}{\ensuremath{\mu}}-calculus from which we derive an extension of Krivine's 
machine for {\lambda}{\ensuremath{\mu}}-calculus. The relation between continuation semantics 
and the abstract machines is made precise by 
proving computational adequacy results employing an elegant method introduced by Pitts.},
