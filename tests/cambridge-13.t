  abstract = {Dependent types reflect the fact that validity of data is often a \emph{relative} notion by allowing prior data to affect the types of subsequent data. Not only does this make for a \emph{precise} type system, but also a highly \emph{generic} one: both the type and the program for each instance of a family of operations can be computed from the data which \emph{codes} for that instance. Recent experimental extensions to the Haskell \emph{type class} mechanism give us strong tools to relativize types to other \emph{types}. We may simulate some aspects of dependent typing by making counterfeit type-level copies of data, with type constructors simulating data constructors and type classes simulating datatypes. This paper gives examples of the technique and discusses its potential.},
