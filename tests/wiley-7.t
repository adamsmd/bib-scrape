  abstract = {A {\em k}-wise independent distribution on {\em n} bits is a joint distribution of the bits such that each {\em k} of them are independent. In this paper we consider {\em k}-wise independent distributions with identical marginals, each bit has probability {\em p} to be 1. We address the following question: how high can the probability that all the bits are 1 be, for such a distribution? For a wide range of the parameters {\em n},{\em k}, and {\em p} we find an explicit lower bound for this probability which matches an upper bound given by Benjamini et al., up to multiplicative factors of lower order. In particular, for fixed {\em k}, we obtain the sharp asymptotic behavior. The question we investigate can be viewed as a relaxation of a major open problem in error-correcting codes theory, namely, how large can a linear error-correcting code with given parameters be?},
