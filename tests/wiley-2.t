  abstract = {We study a random graph model which is a superposition of bond percolation on {\em Z}\ensuremath{^\textrm{{\em d}}} with parameter {\em p}, and a classical random graph {\em G}({\em n},{\em c}/{\em n}). We show that this model, being a homogeneous random graph, has a natural relation to the so-called {\textquotedblleft}rank 1 case{\textquotedblright} of inhomogeneous random graphs. This allows us to use the newly developed theory of inhomogeneous random graphs to describe the phase diagram on the set of parameters {\em c} {\ensuremath{\geq}} 0 and 0 {\ensuremath{\leq}} {\em p} \ensuremath{<} {\em p}\ensuremath{_\textrm{{\em c}}}, where {\em p}\ensuremath{_\textrm{{\em c}}} = {\em p}\ensuremath{_\textrm{{\em c}}}({\em d}) is the critical probability for the bond percolation on {\em Z}\ensuremath{^\textrm{{\em d}}}. The phase transition is of second order as in the classical random graph. We find the scaled size of the largest connected component in the supercritical regime. We also provide a sharp upper bound for the largest connected component in the subcritical regime. The latter is a new result for inhomogeneous random graphs with unbounded kernels.},
