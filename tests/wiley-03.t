  abstract = {For any integer \textit{n}, let ${\cal G}$ be a probability distribution on the family of graphs on \textit{n} vertices (where every such graph has nonzero probability associated with it). A graph \textit{{\textgreek{G}}} is ${\cal G}$\textit{{-}almost{-}universal} if \textit{{\textgreek{G}}} satisifies the following: If \textit{G} is chosen according to the probability distribution ${\cal G}$, then \textit{G} is isomorphic to a subgraph of \textit{{\textgreek{G}}} with probability 1 {-} ${1 \over \sqrt{n}}$. For any \textit{p} {\ensuremath{\in}} [0,1], let ${\cal G}$(\textit{n},\textit{p}) denote the probability distribution on the family of graphs on \textit{n} vertices, where two vertices \textit{u} and \textit{v} form an edge with probability \textit{p}, and the events \{\textit{u} and \textit{v} form an edge\}; \textit{u},\textit{v} {\ensuremath{\in}} \textit{V} (\textit{G}) are mutually independent. For \textit{k} {\ensuremath{\geq}} 4 and \textit{n} sufficiently large we construct a ${{\cal G}(n, {k \over n})}${-}almost{-}universal{-}graph on \textit{n} vertices and with \textit{O}(\textit{n}{\thinspace}2-q{\thinspace}-1)polylog(\textit{n}) edges, where \textit{q} = {\ensuremath{\lceil}}${k + 3 \over 2}${\ensuremath{\rceil}} for such \textit{k} {\ensuremath{\leq}} 6, and where \textit{q} = {\ensuremath{\lceil}}${k + 2 \over 2}${\ensuremath{\rceil}} for \textit{k} {\ensuremath{\geq}} 7. The number of edges is close to the lower bound of \textit{{\textgreek{W}}}(${n^{2- {2 \over k}}}$) for the number of edges in a universal graph for the family of graphs with \textit{n} vertices and maximum degree \textit{k}.},
