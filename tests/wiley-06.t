  abstract = {In 1962 P{\'o}sa conjectured that every graph \textit{G} on \textit{n} vertices with minimum degree \ensuremath{\delta(G)\ge \frac{2}{3}n} contains the square of a hamiltonian cycle. In 1996 Fan and Kierstead proved the path version of P{\'o}sa's Conjecture. They also proved that it would suffice to show that \textit{G} contains the square of a cycle of length greater than \ensuremath{\frac{2}{3}n}. Still in 1996, Koml{\'o}s, S{\'a}rk{\"o}zy, and Szemer{\'e}di proved P{\'o}sa's Conjecture, using the Regularity and Blow{-}up Lemmas, for graphs of order \textit{n} {\ensuremath{\geq}} \textit{n}\textsubscript{0}, where \textit{n}\textsubscript{0} is a very large constant. Here we show without using these lemmas that \textit{n}\textsubscript{0}:= 2 {\texttimes} 10\textsuperscript{8} is sufficient. We are motivated by the recent work of Levitt, S{\'a}rk{\"o}zy and Szemer{\'e}di, but our methods are based on techniques that were available in the 90's.},
