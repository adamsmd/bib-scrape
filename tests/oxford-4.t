  abstract = {{\em k}-Coterie is a useful concept to solve the distributed {\em k}-mutual exclusion problem. The distributed {\em k}-mutual exclusion algorithms based on {\em k}-coteries have benefits of the high fault-tolerance and the low message cost. Harada and Yamashita proposed a basic tree structure to construct tree {\em k}-coteries. When the root fails, quorums are degraded and their sizes grow rapidly. In this paper, we propose the general tree structure to construct general tree 1-coteries to reduce the degradation of quorums. In the general tree 1-coterie, the responsibility of the root to construct small quorums could be adjusted. When the root fails, the degradation of quorums could be reduced. Then, we propose the coterie root-join operation to construct general tree {\em k}-coteries by root-joining {\em k} general tree 1-coteries at a common root. In the general tree {\em k}-coterie, the degradation of quorums and the quorum size could be reduced at same time. We show that general tree {\em k}-coteries could be complemental. Thus, general tree {\em k}-coteries are resilient when the network is 2-partitioned.},
