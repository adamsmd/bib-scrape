  abstract = {In 1962 P{\'o}sa conjectured that every graph {\em G} on {\em n} vertices with minimum degree . Still in 1996, Koml{\'o}s, S{\'a}rk{\"o}zy, and Szemer{\'e}di proved P{\'o}sa's Conjecture, using the Regularity and Blow-up Lemmas, for graphs of order {\em n} {\ensuremath{\geq}} {\em n}\ensuremath{_\textrm{0}}, where {\em n}\ensuremath{_\textrm{0}} is a very large constant. Here we show without using these lemmas that {\em n}\ensuremath{_\textrm{0}}:= 2 {\texttimes} 10\ensuremath{^\textrm{8}} is sufficient. We are motivated by the recent work of Levitt, S{\'a}rk{\"o}zy and Szemer{\'e}di, but our methods are based on techniques that were available in the 90's.},
