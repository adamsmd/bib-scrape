  abstract = {O'Neill (The genuine Sieve of Eratosthenes. {\em J. Funct. Program}. {\bf 19}(1), 2009, 95{--}106) has previously considered a functional implementation for the genuine Sieve of Eratosthenes, based on the well-known heap data structure. Here, we develop it further by adapting this data structure to this particular application.},
