  abstract = {For any integer \emph{n}, let ${\cal G}$ be a probability distribution on the family of graphs on \emph{n} vertices (where every such graph has nonzero probability associated with it). A graph \emph{{\textgreek{G}}} is ${\cal G}$\emph{-almost-universal} if \emph{{\textgreek{G}}} satisifies the following: If \emph{G} is chosen according to the probability distribution ${\cal G}$, then \emph{G} is isomorphic to a subgraph of \emph{{\textgreek{G}}} with probability 1 - ${1 \over \sqrt{n}}$. For any \emph{p} {\ensuremath{\in}} [0,1], let ${\cal G}$(\emph{n},\emph{p}) denote the probability distribution on the family of graphs on \emph{n} vertices, where two vertices \emph{u} and \emph{v} form an edge with probability \emph{p}, and the events \{\emph{u} and \emph{v} form an edge\}; \emph{u},\emph{v} {\ensuremath{\in}} \emph{V} (\emph{G}) are mutually independent. For \emph{k} {\ensuremath{\geq}} 4 and \emph{n} sufficiently large we construct a ${{\cal G}(n, {k \over n})}$-almost-universal-graph on \emph{n} vertices and with \emph{O}(\emph{n}{\thinspace}2-q{\thinspace}-1)polylog(\emph{n}) edges, where \emph{q} = {\ensuremath{\lceil}}${k + 3 \over 2}${\ensuremath{\rceil}} for such \emph{k} {\ensuremath{\leq}} 6, and where \emph{q} = {\ensuremath{\lceil}}${k + 2 \over 2}${\ensuremath{\rceil}} for \emph{k} {\ensuremath{\geq}} 7. The number of edges is close to the lower bound of \emph{{\textgreek{W}}}(${n^{2- {2 \over k}}}$) for the number of edges in a universal graph for the family of graphs with \emph{n} vertices and maximum degree \emph{k}.},
