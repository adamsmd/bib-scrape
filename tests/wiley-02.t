  abstract = {We study a random graph model which is a superposition of bond percolation on \textit{Z}\textsuperscript{\textit{d}} with parameter \textit{p}, and a classical random graph \textit{G}(\textit{n},\textit{c}/\textit{n}). We show that this model, being a homogeneous random graph, has a natural relation to the so{-}called {\textquotedblleft}rank 1 case{\textquotedblright} of inhomogeneous random graphs. This allows us to use the newly developed theory of inhomogeneous random graphs to describe the phase diagram on the set of parameters \textit{c} {\ensuremath{\geq}} 0 and 0 {\ensuremath{\leq}} \textit{p} {\textless} \textit{p}\textsubscript{\textit{c}}, where \textit{p}\textsubscript{\textit{c}} = \textit{p}\textsubscript{\textit{c}}(\textit{d}) is the critical probability for the bond percolation on \textit{Z}\textsuperscript{\textit{d}}. The phase transition is of second order as in the classical random graph. We find the scaled size of the largest connected component in the supercritical regime. We also provide a sharp upper bound for the largest connected component in the subcritical regime. The latter is a new result for inhomogeneous random graphs with unbounded kernels.},
