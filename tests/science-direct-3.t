  abstract = {In this paper, we prove that a plane graph of maximum degree {\it {\ensuremath{\Delta}}}{\ensuremath{\geqslant}}6 is ({\it {\ensuremath{\Delta}}}+1)-totally-colorable if it contains neither chordal 5-cycle nor chordal 6-cycle. This further extends the known class of plane graphs of maximum degree {\it {\ensuremath{\Delta}}} in which every graph is ({\it {\ensuremath{\Delta}}}+1)-totally-colorable.},
